The files in this directory are used for setting up a python environment that can be used
for running the ESMPy tests.

This can be used manually or invoked by the run scripts.

When changing the python and numpy versions that we test / support, changes here should be
kept in sync with:
- The minimum versions listed in ESMPy's pyproject.toml
- The minimum versions listed in ESMPy's install.rst
